			h2#issues Common issues

			section
				h4 Keys stuck when using iPad keyboard
				p.text-fading.
					Due to a bug on iOS system some keys will get stuck occasionally,
					when the key gets stuck just press it again to unstuck it.
				p.text-fading.
					We recommend you use arrow keys for movement as those keys do not get stuck.

			section
				h4 Other players can't see my messages
				p.text-fading.
					This happens when you get temporarily muted for breaking the rules.
					This typically takes from a few hours to a few days depending on severity and frequency of the violation.
				p.text-fading.
					Avoid breaking the rules to prevent this from happening in the future.

			section
				h4 Page not loading or stuck updating
				p.text-fading.
					Try reloading and clearing your browser data.
					If that doesn't help you should check if any of the extensions are causing the issue,
					you can check that by using incognito mode of your browser.

			section
				h4 Mobile keyboard is covering the chat box when the game is installed on mobile device
				p.text-fading.
					Try re-installing the game.

			section
				h4 Screen black or blinking after joining the game
				p.text-fading.
					This is usually caused by outdated graphics drivers or browser.
					Check if your browser is #[a(href="https://updatemybrowser.org/") up to date] and check
					if there are new updates for your graphics driver or your device.
				p.text-fading.
					If your browser is already up to date, try installing different browser.
					We recommend using #[a(href="https://www.google.com/chrome/") Chrome]
					or #[a(href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/") Firefox].
				p.text-fading.
					If other workarounds didn't help, switching Graphics Quality to Low usually works.
					You'll find that option in the game settings. After switching to Low, it
					might take a minute for the screen to stop glitching.

			section
				h4 Graphical glitches, disappearing objects
				p.text-fading.
					This can be caused by outdated drivers or not enough graphics memory,
					see previous points for possible solutions.

			section
				h4 Cannot connect to the game
				p.text-fading.
					This can be caused by outdated browser or network issues.
					Try updating your browser or installing a different one, see previous points for more info.
				p.text-fading.
					Connection issue might also be a result of our DDOS protection service,
					reloading the page and trying again should solve the issue in that case.

			section
				h4 Game slow or stuttering
				p.text-fading.
					This can be caused by outdated browser or some browser extensions.
				p.text-fading.
					Adblock extension on #[b Chrome] browser is known to cause stuttering in the game,
					make sure to disable it to avoid any issues. Other similar extensions may also cause
					slowdowns and stuttering in the game.
				p.text-fading.
					Firefox is known to have issues with stuttering, we recommend
					using #[b Chrome] or #[b Edge] browsers for best performance.

			section
				h4#rules Why can't I create multiple accounts
				p.text-fading.
					This restriction is in place to protect you and the game itself from other players in the game.
				p.text-fading.
					Allowing multiple accounts for single person invalidates ignore and hide systems that 
					allow you to ignore and hide other players that are harassing or bothering you in any way.
					It also invalidates mute and ban system that is in place to protect you from players breaking
					the game rules to bother or harass others.
				p.text-fading.
					Allowing use of multiple accounts at the same time would dramatically increase load on the
					server and potentially make the game unplayable and laggy for everyone else. Increased amount
					of player characters in the game would also reduce rendering performance on slower computers,
					especially on mobile devices to the point when a lot of players wouldn't be able to play the
					game anymore.
				p.text-fading.
					Use of multiple accounts also invalidates any limits (like character limit) that we put on the accounts.
					The limits are in place to prevent large amount of players that we have at the moment from
					exhausting our limited server resources.

			section
				h4 Why can't I modify the game with hacks or scripts
				p.text-fading.
					This restriction is in place to protect you and the game itself from other players in the game.
				p.text-fading.
					Almost all third-party scripts used in-game were used to harass other players. Even when the
					creator of the script did not intend it to be used in that way, the limited knowledge of the
					game and security issues can lead to unintentionally creating a script that's harmful to other
					players in the game.
				p.text-fading.
					Even in the case where the script doesn't seem to impact other players, it often causes performance
					issues for the server or other players. That forces us to work on putting more limits on player
					interactions and takes development time away from adding new features to the game.
				p.text-fading.
					Adding more limits on player interactions also makes the game less responsive and more limiting
					for everyone, not only the players using scripts. This is especially bad for players on bad
					internet connections where network issues can be misinterpreted as use of scripts or spam.
